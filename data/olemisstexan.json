Yes, one must be ready to fire a shot and use deadly force if required, but also as the OP found out today merely the presence of a weapon can cause others to stop aggressive actions.

MAKE IT A CAPITAL FELONY to leave any weapon unsecured resulting in a minor or any other person taking said unsecured weapon and using it in a crime of violence. Yes, you read that right.  CAPITAL FELONY!!!!!   \n\n3.   Allow any ADULT employee of any school to carry.   And NOT a student that happens to be 18. Not what I mean.  \n\n4.   One entrance and one exit to all schools with AIRPORT 3D DIGITAL SECURITY SCREENING AND SNIFFERS.  \n\nYES, the above will cost hundreds of billions.   I know that. But what are our kids worth and what are our gun rights worth.  This way hopefully we can save BOTH!\n\n\nAnd finally.   CAPITAL FELONY for any criminal use of a weapon for everybody.

  "Remember.  If the robber claiming he or she has a weapon and is within 21 feet of you your chances a significantly diminished on getting yours out and in play before he or she is on you.  At the academy the first thing you\u2019re taught about reactionary gap distances is that the closer you are the most likely you\u2019re going to be cut and or stabbed and or shot.  The whole idea is trying to survive it using training and reactions and a whole lot of adrenaline.  \n\nI would definitely draw in this circumstance. No question.   If upon drawing the attack doesn\u2019t cease in ANY WAY I am firing.  \n\nA drill they pound into you at the academy is where you are at the back of a patrol car and holding your metal folding notebook taking down an accident report with two drivers.   This is not a traffic violation stop. Only a traffic accident to be worked.  One of the drivers all of a sudden out of nowhere pulls out a gun and starts yelling about how this was his favorite car the other guy just totaled.  \n\nThe scenario is played out on the 3 FOOT line at the pistol range.  The cadet has to use his or her metal folding pad to write out the accident report while on the scene with two very upset individuals and then one draws a weapon.  The cadet has to react by pushing off and creating distance while firing from the hip as they are coming up on level target.  All of this is done at the less than three feet line and usually closely enough where when the cadet gets to finally full draw their Glock barrel is touching the target.  \n\nThe scenario is about how to react to close in contact.  In the robber case being discussed here the situation is basically the same distance wise.  That is to say you\u2019ll need to work on expanding distance and drawing while screaming and fighting for your life st extremely close range.  If you watch lots of OIS videos you\u2019ll notice the officer backing up as he or she is firing.  This is all part of training for gap distance.  ",

  "If I used that in court every time I got into a fight where dude didn\u2019t want to get out into cuffs I would lose my police certification and certainly be charged.  ",
  "Administrative rules.  We must follow. ",
  "Some drunk guy pushes you in a bar and instead pushing him back or off of you instead you use deadly force.   Not a good plan. ",
  "Let me get this right.   You\u2019re saying simple assault that MIGHT lead to a one punch homicide deserves deadly force.  \n\nThat would go against every single use of force class at the academy   And the courts.  ",
  "I am just amazed at the number of people on here that IMMEDIATELY jump to deadly force when they encounter a physical threat.    ",
  "And blocked....   later. ",
  "Never said they should be allowed to escalate. Only saying the law says you must only match resistance if that agression with the same level.   Google Use of Force Continuum.  ",
  "Goure very welcome!!!    :-)",
  "They are not compelled to arrest.  But look at it this way. How many times has \u201cself defense\u201d later been proven to be homicide?   They \u201cdetain\u201d the shooter until homicide clears them after the initial interviews at the scene.   I make ALL SHOOTERS sit in my car in handcuffs until determination is made. ",
  "Two girls get into a fight outside a bar cause they\u2019re drunk and upset over a guy \n\nFirst girl starts pulling the other girls hair because that\u2019s how girls fight. Other girl pulls out a gun and shoots her for pulling her hair.  Guess who gets charged??",
  "Almost zero unless it lead to a felony.   And how long ago the ex wife was.  If over five years ago almost zero.  \n\nIf last month then that\u2019s different.  ",
  "Agreed.  However view it this way.  If every time an officer on the street had their hair pulled they shot the suspect then there would be a WHOLE LOT more OIS.  a simple fight or hair pulling usually is not enough for deadly force.  ",
  "A physical attack is NOT enough to use deadly force in most situations.  Otherwise every time an officer got into a fight on patrol duty they\u2019d simply shoot the suspect.   A fight it not enough. Must be in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury or death. ",
  "Bwahahahaha.   ROOKIE!!!!",
  "It is questionable whether the grabbing of someone\u2019s hair truly constitutes \u201csevere bodily injury or death\u201d as required under Graham vs O\u2019Connor rule.  Would have to depend on the particular circumstances of this individual situation. ",

  "That is a direct question on your 4473.  When anyone renounces their US Citizenship that immediately makes then ineligible to further own a firearm.

  "Because they pay for once a quarter.   I shoot wayyyy more than that ",
  "Haha.  I know.  ",
  "When I do my LEOSA qualification I just shoot mine.  Qualify once a quarter.  ",
  "My recommendation is to do what we do in the department with our carry rounds.  We shoot our carry rounds at qualification once a quarter.  Three shoots a year are day and one shoot is a night one.   On EACH quarter shoot off all your carry rounds as if you\u2019re qualifying and then buy a new batch and load up.  \n\nThe price of full carry Ammo once every quarter is not prohibitive to most people to replace their carry rounds.   Three mags of 17 rounds + 1 in the chamber = 52.  Means buy two boxes of shells unless you have a few left over somewhere.  ",

  "Here\u2019s a tip.  Do nothing to give probable cause to get pulled over.   That\u2019s your best bet.  ",
  "Ok. Just to make 100% sure the issue is clear here.  When we run a \u201cbackground\u201d\u2019check on an app it is known as a CCH (computerized criminal history) and its done through NCIC.  This is done through the FBI data center.  The TX DPS gives us access also to the TDCJ supervision database and this search is computerized.  Only arrests, convictions and prosecutions for Class B or higher are in any of these databases. \n\nAll of these searches take only a minute to do.  Here\u2019s what takes FOREVER.  Your fingerprints are sent to the FBI and scanned by AFIS.  the scan gives back a percent match and confidence level.  It also gives the fingerprints examiner the card to then physically scan to 100% verify the AFIS match was correct (assuming you were already in there for some reason)\n\nThen the CCH is viewed to make sure there are final adjudications and dispositions to each and every charge or arrest.  If not, then the arrest record and court docs must be requested from that agency to determine final status.  Example:   An arrest for marijuana is in there but no final disposition.  This could be a misdemeanor or a felony depending on circumstances and the investigator needs this info to determine eligibility for the handgun license.  \n\nNow multiply all of that times the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of FBI and AFIS requests received monthly and the thousands of CCW and LTC license requests received by the state.   \n\nLong process.   And each is done through snail mail to get records because no adjudication can be left unfinalized.   \n\nAnd this process is EVEN LONGER when you add in the people applying for NFA Title 2 Firearms.  \n\n",

  "When we quality once a quarter at the range we do the three and seven yard instinctive drills.   Two round quick burst x5 while doing instinctive shooting.  We try to hit center mass with no aiming.  No sir drills are very effective.  \n\nOur department will do night shoots where we out black tap over our trijicons and fire at the 3 and 7 lines.  Quite effective and pretty fun.   They play very loud music over the intercoms at the range and then make pitch black dark.  Then turn on patrol sirens and blue lights and then yell \u201cFIRE\u201d.  \n\nIt is a damned good time!!!",
  "The antis would love that photo.  Shows a clear photo of the serial number so they can call it in stolen!\n\nYes, they do that shit!",
  "Take your weapon anyways.  Fuck em.  ",
  "We already have a registration.  It\u2019s called the NFRTR and I despise it.    ",
  "Remember, that is a skewed number because almost all police officers in Texas have our LTC.  Here\u2019s why:  if we use our department letter to buy a weapon we still have to do the NICS check.  However if we use our LTC any time we buy a weapon we do not.  \n\nSo the reality is that number is completely skewed because the.vast majority of peace officers are also LTC carriers.  There more than a hundred thousand officers here and most of us have our LTC. \n\nIn your percentage did you back out the number of officers without the LTC?   What amount is that?  What percentage does?  What percentage does not?\n\nSuggest you do some more research.  ",
