  "Asking God if he could play it again",
  "I was walking up",
  "The front porch steps",
  "After everything that day",
  "Had gone all wrong",
  "And been trampled on",
  "And lost and thrown away",
  "Got to the hallway,",
  "Well, on my way",
  "To my lovin' bed",
  "I almost didn't notice",
  "All the roses",
  "And the note that said,..",
  "Our song is the slamming screen door,",
  "Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window",
  "When we're on the phone and you talk real slow",
  "'Cause it's late and your mama don't know",

  "Asking God if he could play it again",
  "Play it again",
  "Oh, yeah...",
  "Oh-oh, yeah.",
  "I was riding shotgun",
  "With my hair undone",
  "In the front seat of his car",
  "I grabbed a pen",
  "And an old napkin",
  "And I wrote down our song",
  "Drew looks at me.",
  "I fake a smile so he won't see",
  "That I want and I'm needing",
  "Everything that we should be.",
  "I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about,",

  "Drew talks to me.",
  "I laugh 'cause it's just so funny",
  "That I can't even see",
  "Anyone when he's with me.",
  "He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right.",
  "I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.",
  "He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.",
  "The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.",
  "He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do.",
  "Drew walks by me.",
  "Can he tell that I can't breathe?",
  "And there he goes, so perfectly.",
  "The kind of flawless I wish I could be.",
  "She better hold him tight, give him all her love,",
  "Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause",
  "He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.",
  "The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.",
  "He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do.",
  "So, I drive home alone.",
  "As I turn out the light",
  "I'll put his picture down",
  "And maybe get some sleep tonight.",
  "'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.",
  "The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart.",
  "He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do.",
  "He's the time taken up, but there's never enough.",
  "And he's all that I need to fall into.",
  "Drew looks at me.",
  "I fake a smile so he won't see.",
  "He said the way my blue eyes shined",
  "Put those Georgia stars to shame that night",
  "I said, \"That's a lie\"",
  "Just a boy in a Chevy truck",
  "That had a tendency of gettin' stuck",
  "On back roads at night",
  "And I was right there beside him all summer long",
  "And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone",
  "But when you think Tim McGraw",
  "I hope you think my favorite song",
  "The one we danced to all night long",
  "The moon like a spotlight on the lake",
  "When you think happiness",
  "I hope you think that little black dress",
  "Think of my head on your chest",
  "And my old faded blue jeans",
  "When you think Tim McGraw",
  "I hope you think of me",
  "September saw a month of tears",
  "And thankin' God that you weren't here",
  "To see me like that",
  "But in a box beneath my bed",
  "Is a letter that you never read",
  "From three summers back",
  "It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet",
  "And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe",
  "When you think Tim McGraw",
  "I hope you think my favorite song",
  "The one we danced to all night long",
  "The moon like a spotlight on the lake",
  "When you think happiness",
  "I hope you think that little black dress",
  "Think of my head on your chest",
  "And my old faded blue jeans",
  "When you think Tim McGraw",
  "I hope you think of me",
  "And I'm back for the first time since then",
  "I'm standin' on your street",
  "And there's a letter left on your doorstep",
  "And the first thing that you'll read is:",
  "When you think Tim McGraw",
  "I hope you think my favorite song",
  "Someday you'll turn your radio on",
  "I hope it takes you back to that place",
  "When you think happiness",
  "I hope you think that little black dress",
  "Think of my head on your chest",
  "And my old faded blue jeans",
  "When you think Tim McGraw",
  "I hope you think of me",
  "Oh, think of me",
  "Mmmm",
  "He said the way my blue eyes shined",
  "Put those Georgia stars to shame that night",
